The GX code: documentation home
===============================
	     
GX is a code for solving the nonlinear gyrokinetic system for low-frequency turbulence in magnetized plasmas using Fourier-Hermite-Laguerre spectral methods.
A unique feature of GX is the use of a Hermite-Laguerre velocity discretization, which allows GX to smoothly interpolate between coarse gyrofluid-like resolutions and finer conventional gyrokinetic resolutions.

Another unique feature of GX is that it is a GPU-native code, designed and optimized in CUDA/C++. 
This means you will need access to an NVIDIA GPU to run GX. 

GX is currently under rapid development, resulting in quickly-changing functionality and capabilities. 
A number of planned improvements to the code (such as multi-GPU capability) are listed in the issue tracker on BitBucket (https://bitbucket.org/gyrokinetics/gx/issues).

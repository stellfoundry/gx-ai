Running your first linear simulation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this tutorial we set up a linear ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) instability calculation using the standard Cyclone Base Case parameters.

**Disclaimer**: GX is optimized for `nonlinear` calculations, not linear ones. Other gyrokinetic codes may be better-suited for some linear studies, which could require sharp velocity-space resolution and/or highly-accurate collision operators.
